  **Experimental Dataset Support**

  The NCore dataset integration is currently **under active development** and should be considered experimental.
  Features may be incomplete, APIs may change, and unexpected bugs are possible.

  If you encounter any issues, please report them on our
  `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/kesai-labs/py123d/issues>`_ page. Your feedback helps us improve!

NCore is NVIDIA's ``PhysicalAI-Autonomous-Vehicles-NCore`` dataset. It ships on the same
NVIDIA Hyperion 8.1 sensor platform as the Physical AI AV dataset — 7 f-theta (fisheye)
cameras at ~30 fps, a 360° top LiDAR at ~10 Hz, auto-labeled 3D cuboid detections, and
rig-to-world egomotion poses — but in the newer NCore **V4 component-based format**
(indexed-tar zarr archives, ``.zarr.itar``) rather than raw parquet/mp4 files.

   * - **Name**
     - **Available**
     - **Description**
   * - Ego Vehicle
     - ✓
     - Rig-to-world poses sampled at ~100 Hz. NCore stores poses only (no velocity or acceleration); py123d's ``infer_ego_dynamics: true`` option derives velocity/acceleration via finite differences during conversion. See :class:`~py123d.datatypes.vehicle_state.EgoStateSE3`.
   * - Map

     - Not available for this dataset.
   * - Bounding Boxes
     - ✓
     - Auto-labeled 3D cuboid track observations with the same 10-class taxonomy as Physical AI AV (:class:`~py123d.parser.registry.PhysicalAIAVBoxDetectionLabel`). See :class:`~py123d.datatypes.detections.BoxDetectionsSE3`.
   * - Traffic Lights

     - Not available for this dataset.
   * - Cameras

     - Same 7 f-theta (fisheye) cameras as Physical AI AV, see :class:`~py123d.datatypes.sensors.Camera`.
   * - Lidars
     - ✓
     - 1 top-mounted 360° LiDAR, see :class:`~py123d.datatypes.sensors.Lidar`.


Download
~~~~~~~~

The dataset is gated on Hugging Face. You need (1) a HF account that has accepted the
NVIDIA AV dataset license and (2) an HF token exported as ``HF_TOKEN`` (or passed via
``--hf-token``). A convenience CLI ships with py123d:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install py123d[ncore]          # pulls in huggingface_hub and nvidia-ncore
  export HF_TOKEN=hf_...

  # Download a 5-clip subset (~12 GB) to $NCORE_DATA_ROOT
  py123d-ncore-download --num-clips 5 --random --output-dir $NCORE_DATA_ROOT

  # Or the full dataset (~2.4 TB)
  py123d-ncore-download --output-dir $NCORE_DATA_ROOT

  # Or just one modality + a subset
  py123d-ncore-download --num-clips 20 --modality lidar
  py123d-ncore-download --num-clips 20 --modality cameras --cameras camera_front_wide_120fov


The downloaded dataset has the following per-clip structure:

.. code-block:: none

  $NCORE_DATA_ROOT
  └── clips/
      └── {clip_id}/
          ├── pai_{clip_id}.json                                    (sequence manifest)
          ├── pai_{clip_id}.ncore4.zarr.itar                        (poses, intrinsics, cuboids, masks)
          ├── pai_{clip_id}.ncore4-lidar_top_360fov.zarr.itar       (~1.0 GB)
          └── pai_{clip_id}.ncore4-camera_{name}.zarr.itar          (~150 MB × 7 cameras)


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install the ``ncore`` extra to pull in the NCore reader plus the HF downloader:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install py123d[ncore]


Conversion
~~~~~~~~~~

**Local mode** — clips already downloaded on disk:

.. code-block:: bash

  export NCORE_DATA_ROOT=/path/to/ncore
  py123d-conversion dataset=ncore

  # Limit to a few clips during development:
  py123d-conversion dataset=ncore dataset.parser.max_clips=2


**Streaming mode** — download each clip to a temp directory at parse time and delete it
afterwards. Handy when disk is tight or you want to convert a one-off subset without
committing ~2.4 TB to permanent storage:

.. code-block:: bash

  export HF_TOKEN=hf_...
  py123d-conversion dataset=ncore \
      dataset.parser.stream_enabled=true \
      dataset.parser.max_clips=5

  # Stream specific clip UUIDs:
  py123d-conversion dataset=ncore \
      dataset.parser.stream_enabled=true \
      'dataset.parser.stream_clip_ids=[000da9de-0ee5-465a-9a2d-e7e91d3016bb]'

  # Keep temp files somewhere with room (HOME filesystems often have small /tmp):
  py123d-conversion dataset=ncore \
      dataset.parser.stream_enabled=true \
      dataset.parser.stream_temp_dir=/mnt/scratch/ncore_tmp


In streaming mode each Ray worker downloads its assigned clip into an isolated temp
directory, runs the conversion, and deletes the temp directory before moving on.
Clip-level parallelism therefore also parallelizes downloads.


.. note::
  The default conversion stores camera frames as JPEG-binary Arrow columns (NCore
  already stores JPEG in each frame, so no re-encoding happens) and LiDAR as
  IPC/LZ4. Override via the ``ncore.yaml`` converter config if needed.


Dataset Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Auto-labeled detections:** Cuboids are auto-generated, so they can be noisier than human-annotated ground truth.
- **No ego dynamics in source:** NCore carries rig-to-world poses only. Velocity/acceleration are reconstructed by py123d via finite differences when ``infer_ego_dynamics`` is enabled (the default).
- **FTheta 6-coefficient polynomials:** NCore's FTheta camera model uses 6 polynomial coefficients. py123d's :class:`~py123d.datatypes.sensors.FThetaIntrinsics` has been extended to carry 6 coefficients; the Physical AI AV parser pads its native 5-coefficient polynomial with a trailing zero.
- **Anisotropic linear_cde absorbed into polynomials:** NCore's FTheta adds a sensor→image affine term ``linear_cde = [c, d, e]`` that py123d's isotropic FTheta model does not carry. For the typical Hyperion 8 case (``d = e = 0``, ``c`` within a few percent of 1) the conversion absorbs ``c`` into the polynomials as a geometric-mean (``sqrt(c)``) approximation and logs a warning. Non-trivial shear (``d`` or ``e`` far from zero) raises — silent acceptance would misproject.
- **No HD map:** This dataset does not include map information.
